			Science for Africa is a non-profit organization based in New York City, with the mission
			to empower African scientists through research capacity-building. The Science
			for Africa initiative seeks to promote the scientific research enterprise in sub-Saharan Africa
			through the identification of adequate research collaborators, as well as through mentorship
			schemes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The collaboration framework is exposed through this site, providing tools for researchers
			across the world to collaborate and share ideas, propose or request virtual
			lectures, offer assistance with grant and scientific writing,s and offer/request scientific or
			technical equipment.
		</p>
		<p>
			This framework allows academic and private sector scientists and
			engineers to sign up, free of charge, to identify, initiate, and pursue productive and
			mutually beneficial collaborations linking the scientific communities in North America and Europe with peers
			in sub-
			Saharan Africa. The system matches requests and offers, based on
			scientific sub-specialty and type of collaboration.
		</p>
		<p>
			With this platform, scientists may also share additional needs, resources, and offers.
